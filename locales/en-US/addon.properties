addon_description= Tab Center is an attempt to solve some of the issues that have emerged from the way people use tabs (most notably the “too many tabs” problem) and provide a more versatile UI basis for future innovation. The first version of this Firefox add-on arranges tabs in a vertical rather than horizontal fashion. It is heavily inspired by and borrows ideas from the excellent VerticalTabs add-on.
